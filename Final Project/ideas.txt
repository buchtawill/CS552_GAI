 - Text to Tesla Coil Midi
    - When describing midi files, mention the following
        - Train an embedding space on a very large dataset of midi 
        - Text to Midi under certain constraints (start with text to midi, ignore constraints)
        - Text to vector using pre-trained embedding model
        - Problem Midi to vector (Museformer, REMIs (REvamped MIDI-inspired))
        - Bootstrapping to create more midi data
        - Standard transformer model to map from x tokens to y tokens. Need to generate Y(t+1)
        - Need to get from y vector sequence back into MIDI.
        - Train an encoder-decoder to get from y vector tokens back into midi data 
        - Sike already exists

 - Text prompt to circuit overview / block diagram
    - Start with "I want to create a temperature sensor board that can interface over UART 
      to a motherboard, the sensor board also needs to include voltage and current data"

An "escape room" style game, where a player interacts with multiple NPCs, and the goal of the game
is a flag or other task, defined by an LLM every time.
    - A set of fixed locations, plus one or two newly generated locations.
        - An chill bar
        - Atwater Kent ECE building
        - A Wizard's lab
        - A library
        - The collosseum

Example game settings:
    - You find yourself inexplicably transported to a series of strange and interconnected locations. A cryptic message hints that solving the secrets within each place is the only way back to reality.
